the Efin Core software, see https://efin.io.


Setup
-----
Unpack the files into a directory and run efin-qt.exe.

Efin Core is the original Efin client and it builds the backbone of the network.
However, it downloads and stores the entire history of Efin transactions;
depending on the speed of your computer and network connection, the synchronization
process can take anywhere from a few hours to a day or more.
